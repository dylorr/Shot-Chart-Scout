# Shot Chart Scout Tool
Created using R, Shiny, Todd Schneider's [BallR] (https://github.com/toddwschneider/ballr) and Luke Benz's [ncaahoopR] (https://github.com/lbenz730/ncaahoopR) 

## Visualize and aggregate shot chart data from any player, on any team from any year.

This tool was developed to allow insightful and efficient scouting to be performed by the Virginia Tech Men's basketball program. The tool leverages `ncaahoopR`, an R package for working with NCAA Basketball Play-by-Play Data. Using customized versions of the `get_shot_locs` and `plot_court` functions, this tool aggregated player shot data based on user input and visualizes this data to paint a better picture for player tendencies. This tool is meant to serve in advanced scouting procedures and provide an additional source of input.
